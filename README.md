# Resume-with-NLP

Hiring is broken. Recruiters are drowning in resumes, losing time, and missing great talent.

Resume Screening is not just another Python project — it's a bold step toward transforming how we discover potential. Built with clarity, speed, and purpose, this tool uses intelligent automation to read resumes, understand them, and match them to the right opportunities.

This isn’t about filtering resumes. This is about finding the right people — faster, smarter, and without bias
